## Git Commit Analysis Summary

Based on my analysis of the 42 changed files in this project, I've prepared a comprehensive commit message and Git commands.

The changes can be grouped into three main categories:
1. **Dashboard Implementation**: New dashboard UI with navigation, sidebar components, and responsive layout
2. **User Management Enhancements**: Added soft delete functionality and user locking capability
3. **Post Functionality**: New Post model with ULID support and pruning capabilities

To commit all these changes, use the commands in git_commands.txt:
```
git add .
git commit -F commit_message.txt
```

This will create a well-documented commit that clearly explains all the changes made to the project.
